The Dispatch Toy

This application helps students learn how to enter a 911 call into a simulated computer aided dispatch system. That's all, really. You may use, improve and share it any way you like, as long as you keep it free of charge and give the author credit. Please note that it's not a real dispatch system and cannot be used as such!

This project uses jQuery, jQuery UI and the Google Maps API.
